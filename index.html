                            The Coca-Cola drink dispenser is trying to solve the 3-part problem that (1) people have many drink preferences, (2) Coca-Cola offers 32 brands each with multiple flavors, and (3) dining spots have limited room to supply drink options.

                <li class="list-group-item text-left" style="background-color: rgb(255, 138, 138); border: 2px solid grey;">to fill up the cup to its rim with liquid, users sometimes had to push the dispenser button multiple times</li>

            </ul>
            <h5 style="color: black;">I interviewed the three users and here is the Q&A summary:</h5>
            <ul class="list-group" style="padding-bottom: 2rem; background-color: rgb(255, 138, 138);">

                <li class="list-group-item d-flex text-left" style="background-color: rgb(255, 138, 138)">users found the most essential features and enticing elements of the interface to be the photos of brand and flavor options, the ability to choose from the high quantity of brand drinks in one machine, the single dispenser location that allows users to get both ice and liquid, and the ability to stop and mix drink options</li>
                <li class="list-group-item d-flex text-left" style="background-color: rgb(255, 138, 138)">users won't use the machine if the drinks they like best aren't available</li>

                    <h6>
                        Rushed Riley represents drink dispenser users because I observed that as soon as some users approached the machine, they reached for one brand offering and told me that if their initial drink preference wasn't available, then they wouldn't use the machine or would opt for water.

                        Curious Cindy is looking for a drink to pair with her meal and is curious about trying a new combination of her interests. She faces the issue that sometimes she doesn't get her mixed-drink proportions correct and it takes many attempts to dispense the exact amount of liquid for a full cup.
                    </h4>
                    <h6>
                        Curious Cindy represents drink dispenser users because I observed that many users' favorite aspect was the ability to stop pouring and mix different drinks. Also, many users had to push the dispenser several times to completely fill their cup. Additionally, a user who had a mixed-drink decided to pour some out and re-add some of her original selection, which indicates that she was trying to achieve a flavor porportion and didn't get it intially correct.
